# rahils-notepad
my old wordpress web-site

on my dropbox i kept:  
all of the database copies  
one final copy of everything (db, theme, uploads, plugins, etc.) by a few different plugins  

i'm leaving the rest of the crap here until one day i sort it out...
\-\-

the theme was moved to 'n is now preserved in it's own repo https://github.com/rahil627/rahils-notepad-theme/ . To the arctic vault it goes!
